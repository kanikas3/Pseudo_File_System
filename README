kfs_test folder contains the test application. Use make install to build and scp to the QEMU guest. Then on the guest, you have to execute spawn:
./spawn
This will create a hierarchy of processes. All the processes listen to the signal handler, so you can signal any of them.
The signal handler will just receive any signal and exit after printing the signal and also returns the signal.
